                Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me<br>
                I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
                She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb<br>
                In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
            </p>
            
            <p class="highlight2">
                Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
                Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
                Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
                Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
            </p>
            
            <p class="highlight3">
                So much to do, so much to see<br>
                So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
                You'll never know if you don't go (GO!)<br>
                You'll never shine if you don't glow
            </p>
            
            <p class="chorus">
                Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
                Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
                And all that glitters is gold<br>
                Only shooting stars break the mold
            </p>
            
            <p class="highlight">
                It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br>
                You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older<br>
                But the meteor man beg to differ<br>
                Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

                The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
                The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
                My world's on fire. How about yours?<br>
                That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
            </p>

                Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas<br>
                I need to get myself away from this place<br>
                <span class="highlight2">I said yep, what a concept<br>
                    I could use a little fuel myself<br>
                    And we could all use a little change</span>
